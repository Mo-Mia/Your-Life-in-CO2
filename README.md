## Description

"Your Life in CO2" is a web application that provides users with information about the average carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere in their birth year and how it has changed over time. The app aims to raise awareness about the increase in CO2 concentrations and its environmental implications.

## Features

- **Birth Year CO2**: Enter your birth date and explore the historical CO2 concentration trends in your birth year.

- **CO2 Increase**: Find out how much the CO2 concentration has increased since your birth year.

- **Exceeding Safe Level**: Learn how much the current CO2 concentration exceeds the safe level of 350 ppm.

- **TOCO Balance**: If you have TOCO (tonnes of carbon equivalent offset) credits, the app will tell you how many tonnes of CO2 it's equivalent to offsetting.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/mo-mia/your-life-in-co2.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

1. Run the app:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Open the app in your web browser using the provided link.

3. Enter your birth date in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD' or 'YYYYMMDD'.

4. Optionally, enter your TOCO balance (if applicable).

5. Explore the information and insights about CO2 concentrations related to your birth year.

## Data Source

The CO2 concentration data is provided by the Global Monitoring Laboratory - Earth System Research Laboratories. The data from March 1958 through April 1974 have been obtained by C. David Keeling of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) and were obtained from the Scripps website (scrippsco2.ucsd.edu).
